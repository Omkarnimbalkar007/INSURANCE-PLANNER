              <p>Room rent limit<br>
                Up to single private room permissible for hospitalization in this plan<br>
                Why is it Important<br>
                A lower cap is better as room rent eats into the claim amount which should be spent on treatment cost.<br>
                Restoration of cover<br>
                Reinstatement of Rs 7.5 Lacs for a non-related illness if the original sum insured gets exhausted in a year<br>
                Why is it Important<br>
                It helps at the time of second hospitalization in the same year<br>
